<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Acknowledgments</span></h2>
<p>I am grateful to the late Mr. Fred Siemert, State Forester of the
Illinois Division of Forestry, for suggesting the need for a new
&ldquo;Forest Trees of Illinois.&rdquo; The first and second editions of this work
have been immensely popular, and the need for a third edition is
gratifying.</p>
<p>This third edition is only slightly modified from the second. A few
illustrations and bark photographs have been substituted, and the
key has been improved in places. New material has been added to
the description of the water hickory.</p>
<p>I wish to give thanks to Mr. Al Mickelson of the Illinois Division
of Forestry for encouraging this third edition, and to his assistants,
Mr. John Sester and Mr. Ernest Kunze, for editing it for
publication. Mark Mohlenbrock has redrawn the leaves and fruit
illustrated on pages <a href="#Page_101">101</a> and <a href="#Page_169">169</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>The initial edition of Forest Trees of Illinois was written in 1927
by W. R. Mattoon and R. B. Miller, two prominent foresters in the
state at that time. This was revised in 1955 by Dr. George Damon
Fuller, then of the Illinois State Museum, and E. E. Nuuttila, State
Forester of Illinois.</p>
<p>In 1973, I prepared the first edition of the new Forest Trees of
Illinois with new text, keys, photographs, and illustrations. An
updated second edition was published in 1978. Because of the
heavy demand for this work, this third edition has been prepared.</p>
<p>Woody plants are usually divided into trees and shrubs, but the
difference between these growth forms is not always distinct. In this
work, we consider a plant to be of tree stature if it has a single erect
trunk which branches above the ground to form a crown. It must
have a diameter of at least 3 inches 4&frac12; feet above the ground and an
overall height of 12 feet. Some of the plants included in this work
are borderline between trees and shrubs. The height of a plant may
be influenced by its geography. Thus, the Gray Dogwood (<i>Cornus
racemosa</i>) in extreme southern Illinois may reach the dimensions of
a small tree, but this same species in northern Illinois is also of a
shrubby stature.</p>
<p>Almost every kind of plant in the world is known by a Common
Name and a Latin Name. The Common Name is the one used
locally by residents of the area. It is of limited value because people
in different areas sometimes have different names for the same
plant. For example, one of the trees in Illinois is known by some as
the Ironwood, by others as the Blue Beech, by others as the
American Hornbeam, and by still others as the Musclewood Tree.
Then again, the name Ironwood applies to at least two different
kinds of trees in Illinois. The Latin Name for each kind of tree is
known the World over by the same name. Actually, the Latin Name
is composed of two words, the genus name, which is always
capitalized, and the specific epithet, which is not capitalized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Of all the kinds of plants in the World, none is so well-loved, so
stately and majestic, as a forest tree. More and more people each
year are vacationing and seeking outdoor recreation. Many of them
&ldquo;take to the woods&rdquo; for their leisure, because the forests of our state
hold an unending fascination to many who enter them.</p>
<p>Moreover, trees provide us with building material for our homes,
shade for our lawns and parks, and hundreds of other products used
in our everyday living.</p>
<p>To know the trees we encounter is to enhance our appreciation
for them. The purpose of FOREST TREES OF ILLINOIS is to
bring to Illinoisans a means of identifying the trees that grow in this
state.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Illustrated Glossary</span></h2>
<p>In order to distinguish one kind of tree from another, it is
necessary to learn the major characteristics which the forest trees of
Illinois may possess. Illustrated below are several of the most
commonly encountered characteristics of leaves and twigs. A thorough
understanding of these structures will insure a quicker and
more accurate identification.</p>
<p>On the pages following the illustrated glossary are keys to the
trees of Illinois. A key is a botanical device which enables the user,
through proper selection of a series of choices, to identify a specimen
at hand. Separate keys are provided for trees during the
spring, summer, and autumn seasons and during the winter season.
Begin at the first pair of number 1&rsquo;s, choose the statement that best
fits the unknown specimen, and then go to the next pair of statements
beneath. Continue this same procedure until the name of the
plant is reached.</p>

feet; crown widely spreading and rounded; trunk rather short,
stout, straight.</p>
<p class="revint">Bark: Reddish-brown, becoming roughened into platy scales.</p>
<p class="revint">Twigs: Rather stout, brown, hairy when young, but becoming
smooth; leaf scars alternate, 3-lobed, scarcely elevated, with 3-18
bundle traces.</p>
<p class="revint">Buds: Long-pointed, covered with yellow glandular dots and fine
hairs, up to one-half inch long.</p>
<p class="revint">Leaves: Alternate, pinnately compound, with 9-19 leaflets; leaflets
lance-shaped, curved, long-pointed at the tip, rounded or tapering
to the asymmetrical base, finely doubly-toothed, yellow-green
and usually smooth on the upper surface, paler and either
smooth or hairy on the lower surface, up to 8 inches long and 3
inches broad.</p>
<p class="revint">Flowers: Staminate and pistillate borne separately, but on the same
tree, appearing when the leaves are partly grown, the staminate
many in slender, drooping, yellow-green catkins, the pistillate
fewer in shorter spikes, neither type with petals.</p>
<p class="revint">Fruit: Ellipsoid, pointed at the tip, up to 2 inches long and 1 inch
broad, the husk narrowly 4-winged, dark brown but with yellow
scales, thin, usually splitting nearly to the base, the nut pointed at
the tip, reddish-brown with black markings, the shell thin, the
seed sweet.</p>

<p>Several other dogwoods, most of them rarely if ever attaining the
stature of small trees, occur in Illinois.</p>
<p>Gray Dogwood (<i><b id="g_CornusRacemosa">Cornus racemosa</b></i> Lam.). This plant rarely exceeds
a height of 10 feet. It is distinguished by its slender gray
twigs, its small white flowers borne in clusters about as broad as
high, and its white berries about &frac14; inch in diameter. The Racemose
Dogwood occurs in a variety of habitats, including prairies and
woods.</p>
<p>Stiff Dogwood (<i><b id="g_CornusFoemina">Cornus foemina</b></i> Mill.). This small dogwood has
brownish twigs with white pith and bluish fruits. Its leaves usually
are smooth on both surfaces. It occurs in low, wet woods.</p>
<p>Round-leaved Dogwood (<i><b id="g_CornusRugosa">Cornus rugosa</b></i> Lam.). As the name
implies, this shrubby dogwood has roundish leaves which are woolly
on the lower surface. The greenish twigs have white pith. The
berries are pale blue. The Round-leaved Dogwood grows in dry,
rocky woods.</p>
<p>Red Osier (<i><b id="g_CornusStolonifera">Cornus stolonifera</b></i> Michx.). Red Osier has dark red
twigs with white pith. The leaves are pale and somewhat hairy on
the lower surface. The berries are white or grayish. Red Osier
usually grows along shores, often forming thickets.</p>
<p>Silky Dogwood (<i><b id="g_CornusObliqua">Cornus obliqua</b></i> Raf.). This plant is usually a
shrub, but may get as much as 15 feet tall. It has twigs with pale
brown pith. The leaves are pale on the lower surface, and usually
have white, appressed hairs. The berries are blue. Silky Dogwood
grows in low ground.</p>
<p>Willow Dogwood (<i><b id="g_CornusAmomum">Cornus amomum</b></i> Mill.). The Willow Dogwood
rarely exceeds a height of 10 feet. Like the Silky Dogwood, it has
twigs with pale brown pith. The leaves usually have reddish-colored
hairs on the lower surface. The berries are pale blue. Willow
Dogwood grows in low ground.</p>

<h3>OTHER HAWTHORNS</h3>
<p>Many other hawthorns occur in Illinois. Several of them have
been found only a very few times. Most of them are difficult to
distinguish unless leaves, flowers, and fruits are available. A few of
the hawthorns which are likely to be encountered are described on
this and the following page.</p>
<p>Scarlet Hawthorn (<i><b id="g_CrataegusCoccinioides">Crataegus coccinioides</b></i> Ashe). This hawthorn
grows to a height of 15 feet and has very scaly brown bark. The
slender gray twigs have many stout, sharp spines up to 2 inches
long. The ovate leaves are coarsely toothed and usually shallowly
lobed. There are some hairs on both surfaces of the leaves. The
spherical fruits, when mature, are deep red speckled with several
pale dots. There are usually 5 nutlets inside each fruit. The Scarlet
Hawthorn is found primarily on rocky hills.</p>
<p>Urn-shaped Hawthorn (<i><b id="g_CrataegusCalpodendron">Crataegus calpodendron</b></i> (Ehrh.) Medic.)
The Urn-shaped Hawthorn is named for the shape of its fruit, which
is usually about &frac12; inch long, red, with sweet flesh and 2-3 nutlets
inside. This small tree only grows to a height of about 15 feet. The
leaves are usually ovate and are coarsely toothed and often shallowly
lobed. They have a greenish-yellow color and are hairy, at least on
the underneath surface. This hawthorn frequently grows along
rocky streams.</p>

<p class="pcap">Urn-Shaped Hawthorn</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Green Haw (<i><b id="g_CrataegusViridis">Crataegus viridis</b></i> L.). The Green Haw is primarily a
tree of low, wet woods, where it grows to a height of nearly 30 feet
and has a gray, scaly bark. The rather variable leaves range from
elliptic to elliptic-ovate and toothed to occasionally shallowly lobed.
The leaves are thin and smooth on both surfaces, except for some
tufts of hair along the axils of the veins on the lower surface. The
orange-red fruits are spherical and about &#8531; inch in diameter. There
are 5 nutlets embedded in the rather sweet flesh.</p>
<p>Dotted Haw (<i><b id="g_CrataegusPunctata">Crataegus punctata</b></i> Jacq.). This hawthorn grows to
a height of about 20 feet and has many stout thorns on its twigs. The
leaves generally are broadest above the middle and are obovate.
The edges of the leaves are usually toothed from the middle to the
tip. Sometimes lobes are formed. The leaves have a relatively thick
texture and are hairy on the veins of the under surface of the leaves.
The usually spherical fruit is about &frac34; inch in diameter and contains
3 or 5 nutlets. The Dotted Thorn often forms thickets along the
edges of woods or in rocky fields.</p>

<h3>OTHER WILD PLUMS</h3>
<p>Two other wild plums are occasionally encountered in Illinois.</p>
<p>Munson&rsquo;s Wild Plum (<i><b id="g_PrunusMunsoniana">Prunus munsoniana</b></i> Wight &amp; Hedrick).
Munson&rsquo;s Wild Plum is a small tree rarely more than 15 feet tall and
often forming thickets. It has gray or brown scaly bark, smooth
brownish twigs, and small, ovoid buds. The leaves are oval and up
to 6 inches long and up to 2 inches wide. The edges of the leaves are
finely toothed, with each tooth gland-tipped. The upper surface of
the leaf is smooth, while the lower surface usually has some hairs.
The showy white flowers appear while the leaves are developing.
The fruits are spherical or slightly oblong red plums with sweet,
juicy flesh. Munson&rsquo;s Wild Plum is found only in the midwestern
states.</p>
<p>Narrow-leaved Plum (<i><b id="g_PrunusAngustifolia">Prunus angustifolia</b></i> Marsh.). Also known
as Chickasaw Plum, this is a small tree up to about 15 feet tall,
usually forming thickets. The smooth, brownish twigs usually have
several sharp spines. Most of the leaves are lance-shaped and up to
2 inches long, and conspicuously folded lengthwise. The flowers
begin to bloom just as the leaves start to unfold. The red, nearly
spherical plum has tart, juicy flesh. The Narrow-leaved Plum is
found mostly in the southeastern United States.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Special Places to Study Trees</span></h2>
<p>A number of places in the state of Illinois provide opportunities to
study and to observe woody plants. Some of the major ones are
briefly described below.</p>
<h3>The Morton Arboretum</h3>
<p>A good place to learn the trees of Illinois firsthand is the Morton
Arboretum at Lisle, some twenty-five miles west of Chicago. This
privately endowed educational and scientific institution is devoted
to growing all kinds of woody plants that will survive in northern
Illinois. On the Arboretum&rsquo;s 1500 acres one can find large collections
of oaks, maples, elms, ashes, lindens, junipers, pines, firs,
spruces, and numerous other groupings of woody plants from places
throughout the temperate world.</p>
<p>Certain collections in the Arboretum are along designated trails
and are especially useful in learning to identify trees. Perhaps the
most popular is the Illinois Trees Trail, where native trees are
identified by plaques that show common and scientific names and
give other interesting information about the trees. Another is the
Evergreen Trail, which features conifers.</p>
<p>Some trails emphasize ecology or other aspects of biology but also
feature trees. One of these is the Thornhill Trail, a general nature
trail on which trees are prominent. Another trail links nearby nature
study areas, including a mini-prairie, a wild flower garden, a
northern coniferous forest, and a pond-marsh. A short garden trail,
the Viburnum Walk, is unusual in that it utilizes a grouping of
Viburnums and their relatives to illustrate some of the principles of
plant classification.</p>
<p>Landscape plantings are another important feature in the Arboretum,
and the extensive forested areas provide a dramatic
backdrop for cultivated plantings that have been blended skillfully
into the natural landscape. These are especially spectacular in
spring when flowering trees are in bloom and in fall when the
foliage is in color.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<p>At the Morton Arboretum there is a continuous effort to learn
more about the adaptability of trees and shrubs to the special
growing conditions of northern Illinois, especially the soils and
climate. The natural forests are being used as an outdoor laboratory
for ecological studies, and certain cultivated collections are experimental.
The Street Tree Collection, for example, is a large experimental
assemblage of various trees thought to be suitable for street
and shade purposes. The Heath (Ericaceous) Collection is valuable
in determining the cultural requirements for growing certain azaleas
and rhododendrons in northern Illinois.</p>
<p>The Morton Arboretum has been designed for learning through
outdoor experiences. The grounds are open every day of the year,
and visitors are always welcome. A modest admission fee is charged
for each car entering. In the Visitor Center, an overall orientation is
offered through exhibits and audio-visual presentations explaining
the purposes and functions of the Arboretum. Groups planning to
visit should request advance information about seasonal features,
current hours, special programs, and eating facilities. The varied
opportunities and abundant facilities at the Morton Arboretum
make visits both pleasant and memorable.</p>
<h3>Illinois Natural History Survey</h3>
<p>The Illinois Natural History Survey is a research organization
devoted to the scientific study of the living natural resources of
Illinois. It is one of the Divisions of the Department of Registration
and Education and is administered by a Board of Natural Resources
and Conservation, consisting of the Director of the Department,
the President of the University of Illinois, or his representative, the
President of Southern Illinois University, or his representative,
members and experts in the fields of geology, biology, chemistry,
forestry, and engineering.</p>
<p>The Survey is organized into sections, five of which are engaged
in scientific pursuits. These are aquatic biology, botany and plant
pathology, economic entomology, faunistic survey, and wildlife.
These sections pursue basic and scientific research in systematics,
ecology, environmental quality, and control of plant diseases and
insect pests. The zoological collections of the Survey, numbering
about 8,800,000 specimens, rank among the largest and most valuable
<span class="pb" id="Page_320">320</span>
in the world. The botanical collections are smaller in size. The
vascular plant collections number over 145,000 specimens that are
most representative for studies of distribution in Illinois. The
mycological collections, with more than 35,000 specimens, include
numerous types that are basic to scientific research.</p>
<p>The Survey is housed in the Natural Resources Building and the
Natural Resources Studies Annex on the campus of the University
of Illinois, Urbana. In addition, the Survey maintains special research
facilities at Fox Ridge State Park, Stephen A. Forbes State
Park, Havana, Sullivan, and elsewhere for studies of pond management,
prairie chickens, pheasants, waterfowl, fish, and wildlife.</p>
<h3>Southern Illinois University, Carbondale</h3>
<p>Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, has both a Department
of Botany and a Department of Forestry where students may select
courses from a broad curriculum to study various aspects of plant
life. Many forest-oriented courses are available, and most of them
include actual work in the field. The University has an arboretum on
campus where ornamental species are emphasized. Guided tours of
these arboreta, as well as of the display greenhouse, can be arranged
by contacting the Chairman of the Department of Botany,
Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois 62901.</p>
<h3>DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY
<br />University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</h3>
<p>The department has programs in instruction, research and public
service. The instructional program offers professional undergraduate
training in forest science and wood science and these are
accredited by the Society of American Foresters. Graduate training
is provided only at the Master&rsquo;s level within the department.
Doctoral work can be pursued through interdisciplinary programs
in genetics, ecology, and plant physiology under the general direction
of forestry staff who are members of these respective faculties.</p>
<p>Research is conducted at the main campus, the Dixon Springs
Agricultural Center in southern Illinois (Pope County), Sinnissippi
Forest in northern Illinois (Ogle County), and at other smaller
outlying areas. Support is provided by the Agricultural Experiment
Station and grants from industry and governmental agencies. Projects
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
cover a wide range of subjects related to the production and
utilization of wood as well as the use of forests for non-timber
values. The latter includes recreation and watershed management,
with special emphasis on the role of forests and forestry in water
quality.</p>
<p>At Dixon Springs the emphasis has been on the ecology and
management of pine plantations. These plantings represent plant
communities that have been interjected by man into the natural
succession of abandoned agricultural land to forest. Factors affecting
the growth of pine, and the effects of pine on soil conditions,
stand composition, and the regeneration of native hardwood species
are being investigated. Watershed management studies are also
concentrated at Dixon Springs.</p>
<p>The 2,500-acre Sinnissippi Forest, a private estate provides the
department with research opportunities. A nature tail is maintained
as an outdoor laboratory that is widely used by both adult and youth
groups. Sinnissippi Forest emphasizes the fact that a managed
forest can be aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Public service activities are carried on through the Cooperative
Extension Service and provide advice and information to landowners,
youth groups, and other citizens of the State. This is accomplished
largely through group meetings and demonstrations and
direct replies to individual requests for information. Major emphasis
has been on establishment of windbreaks on farms in the prairie
region; promotion of sound management practices for farm woodlands;
and the care of trees in plantations and on farmsteads.
Extension education emphasizes the development of an appreciation
by Illinois youth for conservation of the forest resource; the
promotion among adults of sound management of rural and urban
woodlands; and program for primary and secondary industries that
concerns the conversion of wood into useful products.</p>
<h3>Shawnee National Forest</h3>
<p>Much of the forested land in the southern tip of Illinois is in the
Shawnee National Forest. The 257,000 acres of rolling topography
in the forest contain 208 different kinds of native, woody plants.
Some of the areas which have a high concentration of unusual plant
life have been designated Botanical Areas by the United States
Forest Service. At these areas, such as Little Grand Canyon,
Jackson Hollow, Stone Face, and six others, plant life is protected.
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">322</span>
These are excellent places to observe many of the woody plants of
the State.</p>
<p>At other areas in the Shawnee National Forest, various forest
management practices, such as selective timber-cutting, erosion
control, and watershed protection, can be observed.</p>
<p>Numerous recreation facilities are dotted throughout the Shawnee.
At many of these, nature trails have been developed which
bring the hiker closer to nature. Descriptive brochures are available
for most of the recreation areas. They may be obtained by visiting
the district ranger offices at Vienna, Elizabethtown, Jonesboro, or
Murphysboro, or by writing to the Forest Supervisor, Shawnee
National Forest, Harrisburg, Illinois.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c8">White Oak, the State Tree of Illinois</h3>
<p>In 1972, the school children of Illinois selected the white oak,
(<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_QuercusAlba">Quercus alba</a></i> L.), as the state tree. It is truly representative for it
can be found throughout the state on a variety of sites. It grows to
its largest size on upland, cool, well-drained coves, slopes, and
terraces where it often reaches 100 feet of height and 3 feet of
diameter.</p>
<p>White oak is one of Illinois&rsquo; most valuable trees. It makes an
excellent shade tree of majestic beauty with a broad round head and
wide spreading branches. Commercially it is an extremely valuable
species used for lumber, veneer, barrels, furniture, flooring, and
construction.</p>
<p>This species is also a part of our national heritage. In the war of
1812, sailors reported that during battle, cannon balls bounced off
the hull of the U.S.S. Constitution. White oak helped make her
&ldquo;Old Ironsides&rdquo; and a part of our history.</p>
<h3 class="inline">DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION
<br />DIVISION OF FORESTRY</h3>
<p>The Legislature has given this Division the responsibility for all
activities concerning the forest and tree resource of Illinois. The
Division strives to fulfill its responsibilities by:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
<p class="revint">&mdash;protecting the resource against all detrimental factors such as
fire, insects and diseases, improper harvesting, etc.</p>
<p class="revint">&mdash;making the public aware of the importance of this resource
to the state&rsquo;s health and economy.</p>
<p class="revint">&mdash;motivating and providing technical guidance to forest and
tree owners for proper management.</p>
<p class="revint">&mdash;practicing and demonstrating proper forest management
principles on Department lands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main objectives of this Division are to promote and achieve
on suitable public and private lands the establishment, protection,
management, use, and perpetuation of our tree resource for all of
the benefits which may be derived from them.</p>
<p>The Division cooperates with and makes full use of federal, state,
and private agency programs, efforts and monies to achieve Division
objectives and benefit forestry in Illinois. Formal cooperative
agreements exist with the United States Forest Service, U.S.D.A.
Soil Conservation Service, Extension Service and other groups,
associations and clubs active in forestry and its related fields.</p>
<p>The efforts of the Division are channeled through five disciplines:
fire control, forest management, reforestation, marketing and utilization,
and urban and community forestry. Each of these sections
has technical leadership at state level plus resource specialists for
field accomplishments. These five efforts intertwine very strongly at
field level where all personnel carry out certain parts of these
programs in designated geographic areas.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c9">ILLINOIS BIG TREE CHAMPIONS</h3>
<p>The Division of Forestry is cooperating with the American Forestry
Association in an attempt to find the biggest trees of each kind
in the United States and/or in Illinois. If you know of a tree that you
think might qualify, send the following information to the State
Forester&rsquo;s office in Springfield: species, trunk circumference in
inches (measured 4&frac12; feet above the ground); total tree height in
feet; and, average width of crown in feet. If your candidate appears
to be a winner, a state forester will be sent to determine the exact
measurements. If it is a winner your name, the kind of tree and its
dimension will be placed on our list. You will receive a certificate
stating that you have found a &ldquo;Big Tree Champion.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
